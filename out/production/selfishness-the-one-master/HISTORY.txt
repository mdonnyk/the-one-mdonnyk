Version 1.4.0 (18 Mar 2010)
  - Added the possibility for each node having multiple interfaces
     * Requires changes to the configuration files, see default_settings.txt
  - New/improved routing algorithms
     * added parametrization for MaxProp (default alpha=1)
     * added Prophet and Maxprop routing algorithm versions that
       take timescale as a parameter, and estimate the needed routing algorithm
       parameters based on that
       * see Karvo and Ott, Time Scales and Delay-Tolerant Routing Protocols,
         CHANTS 2008, for more information. 
     * added new (unrealistic) EpidemicOracleRouter that transfers messages 
       immediately and deletes all replicas from buffers when the message is
       delivered
     * added maximum meeting probability set size support for MaxProp to improve
       its performance in scenarios with many nodes
  - Added MessageReport class for reporting message deliveries,
    CreatedMessagesReport for message creations and EventLogReport for
    reporting everything (in a StandardEventsReader-compatible format)
  - Added application layer
     * applications can be created by extending the Application class
     * multiple applications can run in the nodes
     * report modules can register for application events
     * see PingApplication and PingAppReporter for an example
  - Added ClusterMovement for creating clusters of nodes and LinearFormation
    for lines of nodes
  - ExternalMovementReader supports comment lines (starting with "#")
  - "Delete all" message event and support for this in StandardEventsReader
  - Possibility to choose first route stop for MapRouteMovement
  - Added new message event generators: OneFromEachMessageGenerator and
    OneToEachMessageGenerator
  - Added time range setting to MessageEventGenerator
  - GUI improvements
    * highlighting of pause-events to EventLogPanel
    * GUI starts paused by default
    * hh:mm:ss display for simulation time (right-click the simulation time)
  - Improved and new analysis scripts
    * added "log", "total", and "index" options for the ccdfPlotter.pl
    * added getStatsAverages.pl
  - Bugfixes
    * host range checking in MessageEventGenerator
    * command line option -b doesn't require range anymore
    


Version 1.3.0 (19 Jan 2009)
- New Features
  - ModuleCommunicationBus for sharing information between different 
    (types of) modules
  - EnergyAwareRouter demonstrating energy awareness possibilities and use of
    the ModuleCommunicationBus
    - EnergyLevelReport for reporting the energy levels 
  - ConnectivityONEReport class for generating connectivity traces
    that can be read using the StandardEventsReader
- Enhancements
  - Any number of input config files supported
  - Batch mode supports run index ranges (can start from any index)
    - small change in the command line syntax; see README for details
  - MessageEventGenerator supports message creation time and destination 
    host ranges
  - NetworkLayer has configurable scanning intervals
  - ExternalEventsQueue can be configured like all the other event 
    generators (though the old way is still supported too)
  - ccdfPlotter script has better help and can now also create CDFs
- New toolkit scripts
  - messageLocationAnimator for creating GIF animations out of 
    MessageLocation reports
  - dieselNetConverter for converting DieselNet traces into ONE 
    mobility traces
  - getAverages for counting averages out of different time-stamped reports
  - splotEnergy for creating 3D plots from EnergyLevel reports
- Fixed bugs in
  - handling of incoming messages with expired TTL
  - report directory creation; thanks to STARpio
  - BusTravellerMovement incState; thanks to Mehedi Bakht
  - MaxProp calcTreshold; thanks to Vasco Soares and STARpio


Version 1.2.0 (25 Aug 2008)
- New movement model (framework): Working Day Movement
    - see WDM_conf_help.txt for configuration help
    - sample configuration files can be found from the wdm_settings folder  
    - for information about the model, see our paper at 
      http://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/distance/papers/
      2008-mobmod-working-day-model.pdf
- A "stationary movement model" StationaryMovement.
  - useful for running simulations with only connectivity trace input
  - createCircles.pl script for easily creating suitable configuration 
    files for this movement model


Version 1.1.0 (6 May 2008)
- External Events Interface which allows event generator classes that
  can generate external events (such as creating new messages or 
  setting up and tearing down connections). See EventQueueHandler 
  class for details.
    - due to the EEI, some API changes (in e.g., 
      createNewMessage method)
    - external events file feature is now part of the new interface
    - MessageEventGenerator class for generating uniformly 
      distributed message creation patterns
    - new event: ConnectionEvent (supported by StandardEventsReader)
- Configurable message queue modes (random and FIFO)
- Option to automatically delete messages that are already delivered
  to the final recipient
- Small change in the ordering of checks whether transfer has 
  already succeeded when the connection has gone down
- Connection class has now getTransferDoneTime method
- Settings class can validate range settings (assertValidRange)
- Classes that need to reset static fields between batch runs can
  register to the "resetting service" at DTNSim class 
  (registerForReset)
- Experimental "update scheduling" functionality that can be used to
  dynamically insert "update points" between time steps for higher 
  precision simulations 
- DTN2 connectivity (requires JDK 6 or higher)
- Generic property adding feature for Message class (addProperty,
  getProperty and updateProperty) 
   - SprayAndWait router uses this now for the copy count
- New tests


Version 1.0.1 (24 February 2008)
- New warm up feature for the report modules that allows ignoring
  events and messages that were created during a configurable warm
  up time.
- New routing module: First Contact


Version 1.0.0 (27 November 2007)
- First official public release
